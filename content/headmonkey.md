## This is my big experiment with VIM and Hugo.
### Well, this is my platform to learn them both.

This experiment is to see if creating static webpages will work for what I am trying to do which is 
automate website creation using existing Word Press websites. The idea is get away from what has become the traditional approach.

I really liked Chris Titus' approach, but I am an extreme beginner so I need a video with a bit more hand holding.

Thanks when I found this video.
